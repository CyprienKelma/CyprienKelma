# Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30"/>


### I’m [**Cyprien Kelma**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyprien-kelma/), a Cloud Data Engineer based in Lille, France.

### ✨​ Short Summary :

I love designing, implementing, and maintaining data processing systems that transform corporate data into actionable and profitable return on investment.

After a successful four-month Data Engineering internship at Decathlon in Brussels, I landed a one-year work-study (apprenticeship) program at Decathlon in France. Here I'm furthering my technical skills while completing my last year of software engineering degree at ISEN Lille.

Rather than rushing headlong into things, my approach is to always prioritize system designs that best meet requirements and good practice.
As well as ensuring that solutions are optimized and robust in the long term.

### ⭐​ Tech Skills :
While I advocate for using the right tech for the right task (_rather than choosing with the tempting shiny object syndrome_ 👀​), I mostly leverage the following technologies:

#### Core DE Tools :
- The good timeless classics : SQL and Python (with dbt, PySpark and Pandas)
- Spark for distributed computing
- Airflow and Prefect for batch pipeline orchestration
- Relationnal Databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)
- Java (and Spring Boot for Backend)
- Delta Lake and Databricks, on which I'm currently working to pass the Data Engineer Professional Certification this year
- DevOps/DataOps Concepts and CI/CD with GitHub Action, especially to manage artifact publication and project deployment on dev/preprod/prod environments 
- Docker and Kubernetes (on premise or with Cloud services)

#### Cloud Computing :

I love working with Cloud solution 🙂. And even if I believe more in deep understanding of concepts rather than simple tool use, I have a personal preference building Cloud System with products from the Google Cloud Platform​​. Especially those : BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Runner, GKE, Cloud Run, Dataform, and DataFlow.

I'm currently actively working on the GCP Professional DE Certification this year too.
That said, I'm far from disliking AWS, especially MWAA, S3, EC2, Lambda and ECR/EKS.

#### Areas for improvement :

Although there are too many interesting concepts and tools out there, I'm currently focusing my learning on three things in the short/medium term:
1. Keep and improve the fundamentals. There are always the essentials that aren't very fashionable but are more indispensable than ever.
2. Improve my understanding and ability with Cloud Computing product, especially on GCP.
3. Improve myself in Micro Batch and Streaming concept and tools, like Kafka, Pub/Sub and Flink.

### 🛠️​ Current side project :

I'm currently working on [this Cloud Data Engineering project](https://github.com/Summers-Team/school-m2-bi-project).

- It's a complete ELT pipeline architecture template that can be reused by anyone. The goal is to pre-build a fully working data storage and processing system that cover everything from infrastructure to orchestration and configuration, so that it can be ready to use in less than 20 minutes. Perfect for startup or small company that want to start getting insight from their raw data without spending to much time and energy.

Apart from this one, I’ve got a bunch of interesting public pinned projects.
For exemple, you can check this [scalable, distributed, data system architeture](https://github.com/CyprienKelma/Projet-M1).
